This was the first project I created at CodeClan. Built in Ruby, it uses Sinatra and Postgres Database to allow a user to track expenses from retailers they add. It is fully CRUD (allowing users to add, edit and delete their expenses) and follows RESTful routes.

In terms of styling it was important to me that it had some. And by that I am referrring to the fact that my earlier attempts with CSS, pre-course, had not been great. In my head I pictured something quite minimal that kept a consistent but functional design.
