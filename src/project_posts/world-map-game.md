This project tasked us with designing an interactive learning game for children. So we created an interactive map in which the user could select every country and find out some basic information about it.

When they were feeling confident they could choose to do two types of quizes. One where they were shown four random countries and a capital city, and asked to select which country had the capital city. The second displayed a flag for the country instead.

We originally hardcoded 10 questions per category in a Mongo database. Once we finished MVP however, we went back and randomly generated the questions. We also made a point of selecting countries over a certain landmass, took make it easier for those clicking on the map.
